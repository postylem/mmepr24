/**
 * SurveyJS version: 1.9.138
 *
 * This plugin is a wrapper for the [**SurveyJS form library**](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/overview). It displays survey-style questions across one or more pages. You can mix different question types on the same page, and participants can navigate back and forth through multiple survey pages without losing responses. SurveyJS provides a large number of built-in question types, response validation options, conditional display options, special response options ("None", "Select all", "Other"), and other useful features for building complex surveys. See the [Building Surveys in jsPsych](../overview/building-surveys.md) page for a more detailed list of all options and features.
 *
 * With SurveyJS, surveys can be defined using a JavaScript/JSON object, a JavaScript function, or a combination of both. The jsPsych `survey` plugin provides parameters that accept these methods of constructing a SurveyJS survey, and passes them into SurveyJS. The fact that this plugin just acts as a wrapper means you can take advantage of all of the SurveyJS features, and copy/paste directly from SurveyJS examples into the plugin's `survey_json` parameter (for JSON object configuration) or `survey_function` parameter (for JavaScript code).
 *
 * This page contains the plugin's reference information and examples. The [Building Surveys in jsPsych](../overview/building-surveys.md) page contains a more detailed guide for using this plugin.
 *
 * For the most comprehensive guides on survey configuration and features, please see the [SurveyJS form library documentation](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/overview) and [examples](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/examples/overview).
 *
 * !!! warning "Limitations"
 *
 *     The jsPsych `survey` plugin is not compatible with certain jsPsych and SurveyJS features. Specifically:
 *
 *     - **It is not always well-suited for use with jsPsych's [timeline variables](../overview/timeline.md#timeline-variables) feature.** This is because the timeline variables array must store the entire `survey_json` object for each trial, rather than just the parameters that change across trials, which are nested within the `survey_json` object. We offer some alternative methods for dynamically constructing questions/trials in [this section](../overview/building-surveys.md#defining-survey-trialsquestions-programmatically) of the Building Surveys in jsPsych documentation page.
 *     - **It does not support the SurveyJS "[complete page](https://surveyjs.io/form-library/documentation/design-survey/create-a-multi-page-survey#complete-page)" parameter.** This is a parameter for HTML formatted content that should appear after the participant clicks the 'submit' button. Instead of using this parameter, you should create another jsPsych trial that comes after the survey trial to serve the same purpose.
 *     - **It does not support the SurveyJS question's `correctAnswer` property**, which is used for SurveyJS quizzes and automatic response scoring. SurveyJS does not store this value or the response score in the data - instead this is only used to display scores on the survey's 'complete page'. Since the complete page is not supported, this 'correctAnswer' property also does not work as intended in the jsPsych plugin.
